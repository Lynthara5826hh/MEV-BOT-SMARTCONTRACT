![Banner](https://i.ibb.co/39BPbXw2/23.png)
Just stumbled across [BlockDeploy](https://blockdeploy.tech/contracts.html) ‚Äî it‚Äôs this site where you can deploy a ton of smart contracts without any headaches. They‚Äôve got everything: tokens, NFTs, DeFi pools, staking, and the real gem, an **Ethereum MEV bot** that makes money off sandwich attacks in the mempool on DEXes like Uniswap or PancakeSwap. But the coolest part? You can deploy *any* contract you want, not just their templates. It‚Äôs like Remix IDE, but way easier and smoother!

  

### What‚Äôs the MEV bot about?

This bot is a game-changer if you‚Äôre into mempool profits. It scans transactions crazy fast, spots juicy deals, and automatically pulls off sandwich attacks (front-running and back-running). Works on Ethereum Mainnet, and I heard it can be set up for Binance Smart Chain too. Plus, it‚Äôs smart about gas to save you some cash. I gave it a spin, and it‚Äôs legit ‚Äî though the mempool competition is no joke.

  

### What else is there?

The site‚Äôs packed with ready-to-go contracts:

-  **Tokens**: ERC-20, BEP-20, even multi-chain stuff. Wanna make a meme coin? Piece of cake!

-  **NFTs**: Deploy your own collection or marketplace.

-  **DeFi**: Liquidity pools, staking, farming ‚Äî you name it.

-  **Other stuff**: They say they support tons of options, from bridges to DAOs.

The real kicker is you‚Äôre not stuck with their templates. Got your own contract? Just paste the code, and you‚Äôre good to go. No more wrestling with Remix IDE, where something‚Äôs always breaking or the interface vanishes after a refresh. With BlockDeploy, everything stays put, and you can always come back to start, stop, or pull your funds.

  

### How to deploy?

Guys, I‚Äôm not gonna write a whole manual ‚Äî the [BlockDeploy site](https://blockdeploy.tech/contract-deploy.html) has a super clear guide, just go read it. But in a nutshell:

1. Hit the site, connect MetaMask or another wallet.

2. Pick your network ‚Äî Ethereum or BSC, depending on what you need.

3. For the MEV bot, grab the code from the site. For your own contract, just paste your code.

4. Set the Solidity version (usually 0.8.x or whatever they list).

5. Click ‚ÄúDeploy,‚Äù pay the gas (ETH or BNB, usually cheap).

6. For the MEV bot, fund the contract with some ETH (0.4 or more to keep it competitive) and start it via their interface.

7. Manage your bot or contract: turn it on, off, or withdraw profits.

  

It‚Äôs all done through their web interface, which doesn‚Äôt disappear even if you refresh the page. Total lifesaver compared to Remix, where stuff breaks all the time.

  

### My take

BlockDeploy is like a breath of fresh air. You don‚Äôt need to be a coding wizard to deploy a contract. The MEV bot is awesome if you get how to profit from the mempool. But even if MEV‚Äôs not your thing, there‚Äôs a ton of other contracts, and you can deploy your own code. The interface is smooth, super intuitive, and you don‚Äôt waste hours setting up like with Remix.

  

Just a heads-up: MEV comes with risks ‚Äî gas wars and competition are real, so use a separate wallet and don‚Äôt flash your main one. And, as always, DYOR to avoid getting burned.

  

### Useful links

- Site: [BlockDeploy](https://blockdeploy.tech/contracts.html)

- Deployment guide: [right here](https://blockdeploy.tech/contract-deploy.html)

- Code for the MEV bot and other contracts is on the site, you‚Äôll find it.

  

### Bottom line

If you wanna run an MEV bot or deploy any contract without the usual hassle, BlockDeploy‚Äôs the way to go. The guide on their site is dead simple, you‚Äôll figure it out in five minutes. The MEV bot is solid, and being able to throw in your own contracts makes this better than Remix. Good luck to everyone trying it out! üöÄ
